                <p><i>Reflection of Project: <br> This my midterm project for the Web Application Development course that was part of my CIT Diploma program. This project introduced a lot of new elements that we touched in during class, such as sessions, servers, sockets, and web packing. I am proud of this project as it was enjoyable to create and I got to express a creative freedom behind it by picking the theme. Also, it was actually used by my Dungeons and Dragons group to communicate for a few months after it was completed. I learned quite a few important methods and a brain set when developing a project from scratch. I would have thought of the whole picture before starting instead of starting with what I know (front-end development) and managing to make the rest work with what I have already created (back-end development). In my later projects, I laid out project goals, with ideas on how to complete these tasks before jumping into it. This planning prior to starting has given myself an easier time handling complex problems with projects. </i></p>

                <p><i>Reflection of Project: <br> I am very proud of this project and of my team of what we were able to achieve. In three months, we were able to design a product, see its market value and design a proposition presentation for investors. This was the first big collaboration project I was part of BCIT so there were quite a few hiccups along the way, but each one we overcame and learnt from. Of course, if I were to do the project now, I would change a lot of what we originally set to do, having an achievable scope is now at the forefront when I start planning a project. I know I could improve on this project a lot, but looking back and seeing how far Iâ€™ve come in such a little time only acts as a motivator to see how much I will be able to complete in a few years. . </i></p>
